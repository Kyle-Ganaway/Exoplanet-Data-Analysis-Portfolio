# Exoplanet-Data-Analysis-Portfolio
An Exploratory data analysis of NASA's Kepler exoplanet data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Project Title: Analysis of NASA Exoplanet Data

Objective: An exploratory analysis of over 2000 confirmed exoplanets to identify trends in size, temperature and host stars.

Key Skills Demonstrated: Pyton, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Scientific Analysis

Key Findings: Identified patterns between the planet temperatures and orbital periods, observed that most planets are sized between 1 and 4 times the size of earth, identified 19 potentially habitable exoplanets and observed that the temperature of the star is not necessarily an identifying characteristic.
